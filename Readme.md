# Credit Card Tracker

This is a personal project for a utility I will be creating that tracks credit cards opening and closing. This will also be a learning tool for me to dive more into python and data modeling.

Currently it only displays data from an excel sheet with predefined coloums. 

## Installation

use make to download the requirements and build the project 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt	
python main.py
```

## TODO

1) can add / remove credit cards
2) reminder to close set up
3) credit score from a 3rd party website
